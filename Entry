DAY-1:
Today, I started with the basics of cybersecurity - networking. I learnt what networking is and tried learning about basic attacks that could be made on a website. 
Also, I leanrt a little about LAN.
DAY-2:
I developed an interest in digital forensics and hence decided to learn more about it.  I learnt about the basics and how useful it could be. Also bought this book named "Computer Forensics" by "Willian Oettinger".
